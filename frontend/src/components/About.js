                                Planning Poker is estimating technique designed as digital card game.
                                It helps development teams set sprint goals and estimate time through collaborative planning.
                                The key reason to use planning poker is to avoid the influence of the other team members.

                                The session starts immediately after team leader describes a feature that needs to be developed.
                                Every participant makes his decision about time needed to complete a task.
                                By default, players should not see other participants' votes before the voting process is concluded
                                ‚Äî that‚Äôs why players show their cards at the same time.
                                The main idea is everyone voting independently and only afterwards talking about it.
                                The game ends when consensus is reached.

                                You can use any sequence you like to estimate a user story: linear, hours, days and even T-shirt sizes.
                                But we recommend you classic Fibonacci sequence:
                                &frac12; used for task almost completed, 1‚Äì3 ‚Äî for small tasks, 5‚Äì13 ‚Äî for medium sized tasks, 21‚Äì55 ‚Äî for large aims.
                                The idea behind the Fibonacci sequence is that there is more sensitivity in small numbers and less sensitivity in large numbers.
